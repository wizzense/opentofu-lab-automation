# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflows for the OpenTofu Lab Automation project, organized into a streamlined, more maintainable structure with descriptive names and emoji prefixes for better visibility.

## Core Workflows

 Workflow  Description 
-----------------------
  CI/CD Pipeline(./unified-ci.yml)  Main CI/CD pipeline for validation, linting, and testing 
  Cross-Platform Testing(./unified-testing.yml)  Runs tests across Windows, Linux, and macOS 
  System Health Monitor(./system-health-monitor.yml)  Monitors system health and creates alerts 
  Unified Utilities(./unified-utilities.yml)  Updates dashboard, path index, and documentation 

## Support Workflows

 Workflow  Description 
-----------------------
  Workflow Validation(./validate-workflows.yml)  Validates the syntax of workflow files 
  Automatic Test Generation(./auto-test-generation-consolidated.yml)  Automatically generates tests for PowerShell scripts 
  Update Changelog(./changelog.yml)  Updates the CHANGELOG.md file 
  Automated Issue Creation(./issue-on-fail.yml)  Creates issues for workflow failures 

## Development Workflows

 Workflow  Description 
-----------------------
  Copilot Auto-Fix(./copilot-auto-fix.yml)  Generates AI-powered fix suggestions for open issues 
  Auto-Merge PRs(./auto-merge.yml)  Automatically merges eligible pull requests 
  Package LabCTL Tool(./package-labctl.yml)  Builds and packages the LabCTL tool 

## Features

- **Emoji Prefixes**: All job and workflow names use emoji prefixes for better visibility in GitHub UI
- **Descriptive Job Names**: Each job has a clear, descriptive name with emoji prefix
- **Platform Matrices**: Cross-platform testing uses matrices instead of separate workflows
- **Consolidated Jobs**: Reduced total number of workflows by consolidating related functionality
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error reporting across all workflows
- **GitHub Summary Integration**: All workflows report results in GitHub summaries

## Legacy Workflows (Consolidated)

The following workflows have been consolidated and can be safely archived:

- `pester-windows.yml`, `pester-linux.yml`, `pester-macos.yml`  Consolidated into `unified-testing.yml`
- `auto-test-generation.yml`, `auto-test-generation-setup.yml`, `auto-test-generation-execution.yml`  Consolidated into `auto-test-generation-consolidated.yml`
- `workflow-health-monitor.yml`, `comprehensive-health-monitor.yml`  Consolidated into `system-health-monitor.yml`
- `update-dashboard.yml`, `update-path-index.yml`  Consolidated into `unified-utilities.yml`

## Usage

- **For regular development**: The CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on PRs and pushes
- **For test generation**: The automatic test generation workflow runs when PowerShell files change
- **For system health**: The system health monitor runs daily and after key workflows complete
- **For documentation**: The unified utilities workflow updates dashboard and documentation
