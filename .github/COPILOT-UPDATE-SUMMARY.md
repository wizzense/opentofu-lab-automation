- Reference specific prompts in Copilot Chat
- Combine multiple templates for complex scenarios
- Use in both inline suggestions and chat interactions

### 3. Personal Instructions Setup
- Copy content from `personal-copilot-instructions.md`
- Add to GitHub Copilot personal instructions at https://github.com/copilot
- Customize based on individual preferences

### 4. Code Snippets
- Use snippet prefixes in VS Code (e.g., `psfunction`, `pestertest`)
- Enhanced templates with project-specific patterns
- Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling

## Validation and Testing

### Recommended Verification Steps
1. **Test Repository Instructions**: Check that Copilot responses reference the instruction file
2. **Validate Code Generation**: Ensure generated code follows project standards
3. **Test Prompt Templates**: Use specific prompts and evaluate response quality
4. **Verify Snippets**: Test code snippets for completeness and accuracy
5. **Check VS Code Integration**: Ensure all settings work correctly

### Quality Assurance
- All generated code includes comprehensive error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility is enforced
- Project module integration is prioritized
- Security best practices are included by default
