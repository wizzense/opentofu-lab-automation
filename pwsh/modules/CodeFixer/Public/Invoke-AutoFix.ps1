# If this file is part of a module, this function will be exported if:
# 1. The module has a manifest (.psd1) listing Invoke-AutoFix in FunctionsToExport.
# 2. Or, if it's a script module and this .ps1 file is dot-sourced by the .psm1 file.
# 3. Or, by convention, if this file is in the module root or a 'Public' directory
#    and the module doesn't have a manifest specifying exports (less reliable).
