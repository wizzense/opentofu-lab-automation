## Quick start

Clone this repository and run `runner.ps1` directly. PowerShell 7 or later is
required:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/wizzense/opentofu-lab-automation.git
cd opentofu-lab-automation
pwsh -File runner.ps1
```
**Note:** These scripts require PowerShell 7 or later. Install the latest `pwsh` and use it instead of `powershell.exe`.

### Runner usage

Interactive mode:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1
```

Fully automated Hyper-V setup:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1 -Scripts '0006,0007,0008,0009,0010' -Auto
```

Silence most output:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1 -Scripts '0006,0007,0008,0009,0010' -Auto -Quiet
```

Use a custom configuration file:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1 -ConfigFile path\to\config.json -Scripts '0006,0007,0008,0009,0010' -Auto
```

Force optional script flags and show detailed logs:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1 -Scripts '0006,0007' -Auto -Force -Verbosity detailed
```

### CI usage

In automation scenarios or CI jobs, call the runner using `pwsh -File` so each
child script sees a valid `$PSScriptRoot`:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner.ps1 -Scripts all -Auto
```

Individual step scripts can also be invoked this way when debugging:

```powershell
pwsh -File runner_scripts/0001_Reset-Git.ps1 -Config ./config_files/default-config.json
```

### Writing new runner scripts

All runner steps follow a small template. Import the helper module and wrap your
logic in `Invoke-LabScript`:

```powershell
Param([pscustomobject]$Config)
Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot/../runner_utility_scripts/LabRunner.psm1"

Invoke-LabScript -Config $Config -Body {
    Write-CustomLog "Hello from $($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)"
    # your commands here
}
```



Clone this repository and apply the lab template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wizzense/opentofu-lab-automation.git
cd opentofu-lab-automation
tofu init && tofu apply
```

The configuration reads variables from `lab_config.yaml`, which you can copy from `templates/lab_config.sample.yaml`.

## Documentation

Detailed guides and module references are located in the [docs](docs/) directory. Start with [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) for an overview.

## Python CLI

The optional `labctl` command line utility lives in the [py](py/) folder.
Install its dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and run the
subcommands via `poetry run`:

```bash
cd py
poetry install
poetry run labctl hv facts
```

Launch the experimental Textual interface:

```bash
poetry run labctl ui
```

See [docs/python-cli.md](docs/python-cli.md) for further details.



The repo expects the latest stable code on the `main` branch. When running
`iso_tools/bootstrap.ps1`, you can override the branch with the `-Branch`
parameter if needed.

Linux users can run `./kickstart-bootstrap.sh` to download the example
`kickstart.cfg` and launch a Kickstart-based install via `virt-install`.

It will prompt print the current config and prompt you to customize it interactively. 
The bootstrap script shows your current configuration and opens a simple menu
based editor so you can tweak only the settings you care about. A menu option
lets you apply the recommended defaults from `config_files/recommended-config.json`
for a quick start.



Example opentofu-infra repo: https://github.com/wizzense/tofu-base-lab.git
Example config file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wizzense/tofu-base-lab/refs/heads/main/configs/bootstrap-config.json

To get opentofu setup, really you only need to specify these when runner.ps1 is called: 0006,0007,0008,0009,0010

The runner script can run the following: 

0000_Cleanup-Files.ps1 - Removed lab-infra opentofu infrastructure repo

0001_Reset-Git.ps1 - resets the lab-infra opentofu repository if you modify any files and want to re-pull or reset them

0002_Setup-Directories.ps1 - creates directories for Hyper-V data and ISO sharing

0006_Install-ValidationTools.ps1 - downloads the  cosign exe to C:\temp\cosign

0007_Install-Go.ps1 - downloads and installs Go

0008_Install-OpenTofu.ps1 - Downloads and installs opentofu standalone (verified with cosign). The version used comes from `OpenTofuVersion` in `default-config.json` and defaults to `latest`.

0009_Initialize-OpenTofu.ps1 - setups up opentofu and the lab-infra repo in C:\temp\base-infra

0010_Prepare-HyperVHost.ps1 - runs a lot of configuration to prep a hyper-v host to be used as a provider 

- Enables hyper-v if not enabled
  
- enables WinRM if not enabled
  
  - WinRS MaxMemoryPerShellMB to 1024
    
  - WinRM MaxTimeoutms to 1800000
    
  - TrustedHosts to '*'
    
  - Negotiate to True
    
- creates a self-signed RootCA Cert (prompts for password)
  
- creates self-signed host certificate (prompts for password)
  
- Configured WinRM HTTPs Listener
  
- Allows HTTP 5986 through firewall
  
- Creates a Go workspace in C:\GoWorkspace
  
  - Builds the hyperv-provider for opentofu from tailiesins git
    
  - Copies the provider to the lab-infra
  - Converts the generated certificates to PEM files and updates `providers.tf`

**Certificate prerequisites**

- You will be prompted for passwords when creating the Root CA and host certificates. Use the same password when asked.
- Ensure WinRM HTTPS (port 5986) is allowed through the firewall.
- Typical WinRM settings set by the script: `WinRS MaxMemoryPerShellMB = 1024`, `WinRM MaxTimeoutms = 1800000`, `TrustedHosts = '*'`, `Negotiate = True`.

Scripts `0006`–`0010` form the minimal path to a working Hyper‑V provider. On Server Core 2025 you can run them non‑interactively with:

```powershell
./runner.ps1 -Scripts '0006,0007,0008,0009,0010' -Auto -Quiet
```
You can also pass `-Verbosity` with `silent`, `normal`, or `detailed` to control
the amount of console logging.

Completely optional scripts I use for other tasks:

To run ALL scripts, type 'all'.
To run one or more specific scripts, provide comma separated 4-digit prefixes (e.g. 0001,0003).
Or type 'exit' to quit this script.

## Logging

All scripts output to the console using `Write-CustomLog`. If no log file is
specified, a file named `lab.log` is created in `C:\temp` on Windows (or the
system temporary directory on other platforms). Set the `LAB_LOG_DIR`
environment variable or `$script:LogFilePath` to override the location. The
`labctl` Python CLI uses the same variable and writes to `lab.log` within that
directory.

Make sure to modify the 'main.tf' so it uses your admin credentials and hostname/IP of the host machine if you don't have a customized config.json or choose not to customize.

provider "hyperv" {
  user            = "ad\\administrator"
  password        = ""
  host            = "192.168.1.121"
  port            = 5986
  https           = true
  insecure        = true  # This skips SSL validation
  use_ntlm        = true  # Use NTLM as it's enabled on the WinRM service
  tls_server_name = ""
  cacert_path     = ""    # Leave empty if skipping SSL validation
  cert_path       = ""    # Leave empty if skipping SSL validation
  key_path        = ""    # Leave empty if skipping SSL validation
  script_path     = "C:/Temp/terraform_%RAND%.cmd"
  timeout         = "30s"
}


variable "hyperv_host_name" {
  type    = string
  default = "192.168.1.121"
}

variable "hyperv_user" {
  type    = string
  default = "ad\\administrator"
}

variable "hyperv_password" {
  type    = string
  default = ""
}

You will also have to modify:


hyperv_vhd: Create multiple VHD objects (one per VM) with distinct paths

resource "hyperv_vhd" "control_node_vhd" {
  count = var.number_of_vms

  depends_on = [hyperv_network_switch.Lan]

  Unique path for each VHD (e.g. ...-0.vhdx, ...-1.vhdx, etc.)
  path = "B:\\hyper-v\\PrimaryControlNode\\PrimaryControlNode-Server2025-${count.index}.vhdx"
  size = 60737421312
}

And:

  dvd_drives {
    controller_number   = "0"
    controller_location = "1"
    path                = "B:\\share\\isos\\2_auto_unattend_en-us_windows_server_2025_updated_feb_2025_x64_dvd_3733c10e.iso"
  }


Will probably change repo name to just 'lab-automation'.

## Node dependency configuration

Node-related installs are controlled under the `Node_Dependencies` section of
`default-config.json`:

```json
"Node_Dependencies": {
  "InstallNode": true,
  "InstallYarn": true,
  "InstallVite": true,
  "InstallNodemon": true,
  "InstallNpm": true,
  "GlobalPackages": ["yarn", "vite", "nodemon"],
  "NpmPath": "C:\\Projects\\vde-mvp\\frontend",
  "CreateNpmPath": false,
  "Node": {
    "InstallerUrl": "https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.1/node-v20.11.1-x64.msi"
  }
}
```

The `GlobalPackages` array is the preferred way to list npm packages for
`0202_Install-NodeGlobalPackages.ps1`. The older boolean flags (`InstallYarn`,
`InstallVite`, `InstallNodemon`) are still honored for backward compatibility.

The scripts `0201_Install-NodeCore.ps1`, `0202_Install-NodeGlobalPackages.ps1`
and `0203_Install-npm.ps1` read these keys when installing Node, global npm
  packages, or project dependencies.

## Directory configuration

Directories used by several scripts are defined under the `Directories` section
of `default-config.json`:

```json
"Directories": {
  "HyperVPath": "C:\\HyperV",
  "IsoSharePath": "C:\\iso_share"
}
```

`0002_Setup-Directories.ps1` ensures these locations exist before other steps
run.

## Hyper-V configuration

Hyper-V installation options are defined under the `HyperV` section of
`default-config.json`. The `EnableManagementTools` flag controls whether the
Hyper-V management tools are installed alongside the main feature.

```json
"HyperV": {
  "EnableManagementTools": true,
  "User": "",
  "Password": "",
  ...
}
```

`0105_Install-HyperV.ps1` reads this value when calling
`Install-WindowsFeature`. If the property is missing, the script defaults to
`true`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter `fatal: Class not registered` after a browser window briefly opens,
the Git credential manager could not launch the authentication flow.
Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and authenticate once before
running the automation scripts:

```powershell
gh auth login
gh repo clone <owner/repo>
```

Using `gh` avoids the COM initialization issues seen with some Git installations
and prevents Git from prompting for a username like `user@github.com`.

The bootstrap script automatically marks the cloned repository as a
`safe.directory` in your global Git config. If you encounter a
"detected dubious ownership" error when running Git manually,
add the path yourself:

```powershell
git config --global --add safe.directory <path>
```

## Running tests

PowerShell 7 or later is required to run the Pester suite. Install `pwsh` with
your platform's package manager and then execute the tests:

```bash
# Windows
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell -e

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y powershell

# macOS
brew install --cask powershell

pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-Pester"
```

Windows-specific tests must run on a Windows host. If you don't have one
available, rely on the CI pipeline and fetch the job results with
`lab_utils/Get-WindowsJobArtifacts.ps1` once the run completes. A quick
workflow is:

1. Edit your files.
2. `git commit -am "<message>"`
3. `git push`
4. Run `lab_utils/Get-WindowsJobArtifacts.ps1` to download the artifacts.

The suite includes a YAML parsing test that is skipped unless the
`powershell-yaml` module is installed. Install it (optionally) with:

```powershell
Install-Module powershell-yaml -Scope CurrentUser
```

Download the latest Windows test results with `lab_utils/Get-WindowsJobArtifacts.ps1`.
If the GitHub CLI isn't authenticated, the script falls back to public
downloads via the nightly.link service. You can also pass a specific
workflow run ID obtained from `gh run list`. Because run IDs are 64-bit
integers, wrap the value in quotes on PowerShell. Coverage archives are
only uploaded when the tests pass, so the helper will skip them if absent:

```powershell
gh run list --limit 20
lab_utils/Get-WindowsJobArtifacts.ps1 -RunId "<id>"
```

Python unit tests live under `py/`. Install the dependencies first using
either Poetry or a direct `pip` install to get packages like `typer`:

```bash
# with Poetry
poetry install

# or with pip
pip install -e ./py
```

Once installed, run the pytest suite:

```bash
cd py
poetry run pytest
```

## Utility scripts

`lab_utils/Get-Platform.ps1` detects the current platform.
Load the function and call it to get `Windows`, `Linux` or `MacOS`.

```powershell
. ./lab_utils/Get-Platform.ps1
Get-Platform
```

Use this output to branch your automation logic according to the host
operating system. Check the other `lab_utils` scripts for additional
cross-platform helpers.
