# PatchManager Unicode Sanitization Integration - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully integrated automatic Unicode/emoji sanitization into the PatchManager v2.0 consolidated workflow and enhanced both issue and PR creation with rich, detailed tracking output.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Automatic Unicode Sanitization Integration

**File**: `core-runner/modules/PatchManager/Public/Invoke-PatchWorkflow.ps1`

- Added automatic Unicode/emoji sanitization before every commit
- Sanitization runs on all changed files detected by `git diff --name-only HEAD`
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation if sanitization fails
- Detailed logging of sanitization results (files modified, characters removed)

**Process Flow**:
1. Patch operation executes
2. Git detects changed files
3. **NEW**: Unicode sanitizer processes all changed files
4. Files are sanitized of problematic Unicode characters and emoji
5. Changes are committed with clean, cross-platform compatible content

### 2. Enhanced Pull Request Creation

**File**: `core-runner/modules/PatchManager/Public/New-PatchPR.ps1`

- **Rich System Information**: PowerShell version, OS, hostname, user context
- **Comprehensive Git Details**: Current branch, last commit, repository URL, working tree status
- **Detailed Quality Assurance Checklist**: Pre-merge validation, integration checks
- **Professional Tables**: Technical details in organized markdown tables
- **Automation Tracking**: PatchManager version, workflow details, sanitization status
- **Review Guidelines**: 5-step process for thorough code review

**Key Improvements**:
- Matches the detail level of the enhanced issue creation
- Professional, maintainable format following project standards
- No emoji/Unicode output - clean cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive pre-merge checklist for quality assurance

### 3. VS Code Task Integration

**File**: `.vscode/tasks.json`

Added two new tasks for Unicode sanitization:

1. **"PatchManager: Sanitize Unicode/Emoji"** - Dry run preview
2. **"PatchManager: Apply Unicode/Emoji Sanitization"** - Apply changes

Both tasks integrate with the existing PatchManager task workflow for consistent user experience.

### 4. PowerShell Compatibility Fixes

- Fixed null-coalescing operator usage for PowerShell 7.0+ compatibility
- Corrected here-string escaping issues in PR body generation
- Ensured cross-platform variable handling for hostname and username

## Technical Implementation Details

### Unicode Sanitizer Function

**File**: `core-runner/modules/PatchManager/Private/Invoke-UnicodeSanitizer.ps1`

- **Coverage**: 15+ Unicode ranges including all major emoji sets
- **Conversion Map**: Common emoji to text equivalents (✅ → [OK], 🚀 → [ROCKET], etc.)
- **File Types**: Supports .ps1, .psm1, .psd1, .md, .txt, .json, .yml, .yaml, .py, .js, .ts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with detailed error reporting
- **Performance**: Efficient regex-based pattern matching

### Integration Points

1. **Invoke-PatchWorkflow**: Calls sanitizer before git commit
2. **VS Code Tasks**: Direct access to sanitization functions
3. **Private Module**: Not exported, used only internally by PatchManager

## Testing and Validation

### ✅ Completed Tests

1. **Dry Run Workflow**: Confirmed sanitization integration works
2. **Module Loading**: All functions load correctly without syntax errors
3. **Enhanced PR Output**: Rich, detailed PR body generation verified
4. **Enhanced Issue Output**: Already working with comprehensive tracking details
5. **VS Code Tasks**: New sanitization tasks added and functional
