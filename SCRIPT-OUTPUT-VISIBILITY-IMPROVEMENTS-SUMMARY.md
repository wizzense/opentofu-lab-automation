# Script Output Visibility Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to ensure that important script output is visible to users when running the OpenTofu Lab Automation core runner interactively.

## ✅ COMPLETED - Logging Clutter Reduction (Latest Update)

**Problem**: Even after fixing script output visibility, normal mode was still cluttered with INFO and SUCCESS level log messages that distracted from the clean user-facing output.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed normal mode logging level from `INFO` to `WARN` (only shows warnings and errors)
- Moved core runner startup/completion messages to `DEBUG` level
- Reduced logging noise while preserving script execution tracking
- Maintained full diagnostic information in detailed mode

**Result**: Normal mode now shows clean, prominent script output with minimal logging distraction:

```
=== System Information ===
Computer Name: codespaces-4f62e8
Platform: Linux
OS Version: Linux 6.8.0-1027-azure
[...clean, formatted output...]
=========================
```

**Technical Changes**:
```powershell
# Before: normal = 'INFO' (showed all INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR messages)
# After:  normal = 'WARN'     # Clean UX - warnings and errors only
$script:VerbosityToLogLevel = @{
    silent = 'ERROR'    # Only errors
    normal = 'WARN'     # Clean UX - warnings and errors only
    detailed = 'DEBUG'  # Full diagnostics
}
```

## Problem Statement
The `Get-SystemInfo` script (and potentially other scripts) were not displaying key information to users in normal interactive mode. Users would see only logging messages but not the actual system information they expected to see.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Get-SystemInfo.ps1 Script

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ **Division by Zero Error**: Fixed calculation of disk usage percentages when disk size is 0
- ✅ **No Visible Output**: Added comprehensive user-facing output for system information
- ✅ **Mode-Specific Output**: Implemented different output levels for normal and detailed modes

**Key Improvements:**
```powershell
# Now shows in normal mode:
=== System Information ===
Computer Name: codespaces-4f62e8
Platform: Linux
OS Version: Linux 6.8.0-1027-azure
IP Addresses: 127.0.0.1, 10.0.1.93

Disk Information:
  / (Fixed): 18.72GB free / 31.33GB total (40.2% used)
  [... additional disk info ...]
=========================
```

**Technical Changes:**
- Added safety check for disk size division: `if ($disk.SizeGB -gt 0)`
- Implemented user-facing `Write-Host` output for key information
- Maintained detailed mode for complete system information
- Added color-coded output for better readability

### 2. Enhanced Core Runner Output Handling

**Previously Implemented Features:**
- ✅ **Script Output Detection**: Core runner now detects when scripts produce no visible output
- ✅ **Summary Reporting**: Provides feedback about script execution and output visibility
- ✅ **PatchManager Integration**: Optional automated issue creation for scripts with no output
- ✅ **Verbosity Mapping**: Proper mapping of verbosity levels to logging levels

## Validation Results

### Test Case 1: Normal Mode
```bash
pwsh -File "./core-runner/core_app/core-runner.ps1" -NonInteractive -Scripts "0200_Get-SystemInfo" -Verbosity normal
```

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
- System information clearly visible to user
- Key details displayed: computer name, platform, OS version, IP addresses, disk usage
- No errors or division by zero issues
- Script execution successful with visible outputs: 31

### Test Case 2: Detailed Mode
```bash
pwsh -File "./core-runner/core_app/core-runner.ps1" -NonInteractive -Scripts "0200_Get-SystemInfo" -Verbosity detailed
```

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
- All normal mode information displayed
- Additional detailed information available
- Consistent output across different verbosity levels

## Implementation Pattern for Other Scripts

When creating or fixing scripts, follow this pattern to ensure user visibility:

```powershell
# Always show key information in normal and detailed modes
if ($params.Verbosity -ne 'silent') {
    Write-Host "`n=== Script Results ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host "Key Information: $keyData" -ForegroundColor Green
    # ... additional user-facing output
    Write-Host "======================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}

# Show additional details only in detailed mode
if ($params.Verbosity -eq 'detailed') {
    Write-Host "`n=== Detailed Information ===" -ForegroundColor Magenta
    # ... detailed output
    Write-Host "============================" -ForegroundColor Magenta
}
```

## Best Practices Established

### For Script Authors
1. **User-Facing Output**: Use `Write-Host` for information users need to see
2. **Internal Logging**: Use `Write-CustomLog` for execution tracking and debugging
3. **Safety Checks**: Always validate calculations to prevent runtime errors
4. **Color Coding**: Use consistent colors for different types of information
5. **Mode Awareness**: Respect verbosity settings while ensuring key info is visible

### For Core Runner Development
6. **Clean Normal Mode**: Keep normal mode focused on user experience with minimal logging noise
7. **Full Detailed Mode**: Provide complete diagnostic information in detailed mode
8. **Centralized Execution**: Use helper functions for consistent script execution patterns
9. **Output Detection**: Track and warn about scripts with no visible output

### For Logging Strategy
10. **Separation of Concerns**: User output (Write-Host) vs logging (Write-CustomLog) serve different purposes
11. **Appropriate Levels**: Use WARN for normal mode, DEBUG for detailed mode to control noise
12. **Script-Level Logging**: Individual scripts should handle their own execution logging needs

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes
- ✅ Users now see system information when running Get-SystemInfo
- ✅ No more division by zero errors
- ✅ Better user experience with clear, formatted output
- ✅ Consistent output handling across verbosity modes
- ✅ Enhanced debugging capabilities with output detection

### Technical Debt Reduced
- ✅ Eliminated silent script execution issues
- ✅ Improved error handling robustness
- ✅ Better alignment between user expectations and actual output

## Future Recommendations

1. **Script Audit**: Review other scripts for similar output visibility issues
2. **Standardization**: Apply the established output pattern to all user-facing scripts
3. **Testing**: Add automated tests to verify script output visibility
4. **Documentation**: Update script documentation to clarify expected user output

## Files Modified

1. `/workspaces/opentofu-lab-automation/core-runner/core_app/scripts/0200_Get-SystemInfo.ps1`
   - Fixed division by zero error in disk usage calculation
   - Added comprehensive user-facing output for system information
   - Implemented mode-specific output handling

2. `/workspaces/opentofu-lab-automation/core-runner/core_app/core-runner.ps1` (Previously)
   - Enhanced script execution with output detection
   - Added summary reporting for scripts with no visible output
   - Implemented PatchManager integration for issue tracking

## Conclusion

The improvements successfully address the original issue of script output visibility. Users running the OpenTofu Lab Automation core runner interactively will now see important script output (especially from scripts like Get-SystemInfo) regardless of verbosity mode, while maintaining appropriate detail levels based on user preferences.

The established patterns and best practices provide a foundation for ensuring consistent user experience across all scripts in the automation framework.
