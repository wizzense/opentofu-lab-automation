## Prerequisites

### Required Modules
- **PatchManager** - Core functionality
- **Logging** - Enhanced output (optional)

### Environment Variables
- `$env:PROJECT_ROOT` - Automatically detected or set to current directory
- `$env:PWSH_MODULES_PATH` - Set by PatchManager initialization

### Git Repository
- Must be run within a Git repository
- Git must be configured with user name and email
- Repository should have a `main` branch

## Safety Features

### Dry Run Mode
All demos support `-DryRun` mode which:
- ✅ Shows what operations would be performed
- ✅ Creates branch names and displays them
- ✅ Runs validation without making changes
- ❌ Does not create actual files or commits
- ❌ Does not push to remote repositories

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
- Graceful degradation when modules are unavailable
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- Automatic cleanup of failed operations

## Integration with PatchManager

The demo script uses the same PatchManager functions you would use in real scenarios:

```powershell
# Basic patch creation
Invoke-GitControlledPatch -PatchDescription "My patch" -PatchOperation { ... }

# Advanced patch with testing
Invoke-GitControlledPatch -PatchDescription "Advanced patch" `
    -PatchOperation { ... } `
    -TestCommands @("test-command-1", "test-command-2") `
    -AutoCommitUncommitted

# Rollback operations
Invoke-PatchRollback -BranchName "patch/..." -RollbackType "ResetToParent"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Module Import Errors
If you see module import errors:
```
⚠️  Could not import PatchManager module. Please ensure modules are available.
   Expected path: /path/to/core-runner/modules/PatchManager
```

**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the project root directory or set `$env:PROJECT_ROOT` correctly.

### Git Configuration Errors
If you see Git-related errors:
```
❌ Git repository not properly configured
```

**Solution**: Ensure you're in a Git repository and have configured:
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Permission Errors
If you see permission-related errors:
```
❌ Failed to create branch or commit
```

**Solution**: 
- Run PowerShell as Administrator (Windows)
- Check file permissions in the repository directory
- Ensure Git has write access to the repository

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Demo Scenarios
You can modify the demo script to add your own scenarios:

```powershell
function Invoke-MyCustomDemo {
    Write-DemoHeader "My Custom Demo" "Description of what this demonstrates"
    
    try {
        Write-DemoStep "1. My custom step"
        
        $patchResult = Invoke-GitControlledPatch `
            -PatchDescription "My custom patch" `
            -PatchOperation {
                # Your custom operations here
                Write-Host "Performing custom operations..."
            } `
            -DryRun:$DryRun
            
        if ($patchResult.Success) {
            Write-DemoSuccess "Custom demo completed successfully"
        } else {
            Write-DemoError "Custom demo failed" $patchResult.Error
        }
        
    } catch {
        Write-DemoError "Custom demo encountered an exception" $_.Exception.Message
    }
}
```

### Automated Testing
Use the demo in CI/CD pipelines:

```powershell
# Automated validation in CI
.\demo-patchmanager.ps1 -DemoMode All -DryRun -Quiet
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Error "PatchManager demo validation failed"
    exit 1
}
```

## Files Created

During demonstrations (when not using `-DryRun`), these temporary files may be created:
- `demo-timestamp.txt` - Basic demo timestamp file
- `demo-config.json` - Advanced demo configuration
- `demo-rollback-test.txt` - Rollback demo test file (then removed)

These files are safe to delete after the demonstration.

## Next Steps

After running the demo:

1. **Review created branches** - Use `git branch -a` to see demo branches
2. **Try manual patches** - Use `Invoke-GitControlledPatch` directly
3. **Set up aliases** - Run `Set-PatchManagerAliases` for daily use
4. **Explore advanced features** - Check automated error tracking
5. **Integrate with workflows** - Add PatchManager to your development process

## Support

For questions or issues:
- Review the PatchManager module documentation
- Check the project's GitHub repository
- Run the demo with `-Interactive` for step-by-step guidance
- Use `-DryRun` mode to safely explore functionality
