Got it. I’ll prepare a prioritized, de-duplicated summary of all outstanding issues across your codebase and express it as structured tasks AI agents can act on using your existing PatchManager module. I’ll also include an enhanced, reusable prompt you can use to direct AI agents efficiently.

I’ll get started and let you know once it’s ready.


# Python Codebase Maintenance Task Summary

The following is a structured list of maintenance tasks identified from raw issue notes. Tasks are grouped by issue type, de-duplicated for uniqueness, and prioritized for resolution. Each task includes a title, priority level, affected files/modules, a recommended action, guidance for automation (using the PatchManager and CodeFixer AI modules), and the expected outcome after completion.

## Indentation Errors

1. **Title:** Fix Indentation in Config Loader Module
   **Priority:** Critical
   **Affected Files:** `config_loader.py`
   **Action:** Correct inconsistent indentation (mixed tabs/spaces) that is causing an `IndentationError`. Replace all tabs with four spaces and ensure code blocks are properly aligned.
   **Automation Guidance:** Use PatchManager with a code formatter (or CodeFixer’s auto-format suggestion) to re-indent the file according to PEP 8 standards. The AI agent should verify that no syntax errors remain after reformatting.
   **Expected Outcome:** `config_loader.py` has consistent four-space indentation. The module executes without indentation-related errors and passes linting checks.

2. **Title:** Fix Indentation in Data Parser Function
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `data_parser.py`
   **Action:** Align the misindented code block in the data parsing function. An inner block (e.g. inside a loop or conditional) is not indented correctly, which could lead to logic errors or warnings. Adjust the indentation to match the surrounding code structure.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should open `data_parser.py` via PatchManager and locate the flagged indentation issue (possibly indicated by a linter). Use CodeFixer or an auto-formatter to realign the code block. Double-check that the function’s logic remains intact after the fix.
   **Expected Outcome:** All code in `data_parser.py` follows consistent indentation levels. The file has no indentation warnings, and functionality is unchanged except for the removal of the formatting issue.

## Missing Dependencies

1. **Title:** Add Missing YAML Dependency
   **Priority:** Critical
   **Affected Files:** `pyproject.toml` (project dependencies), `config_loader.py` (or wherever `yaml` is used)
   **Action:** Include the PyYAML library in the project’s dependencies. The codebase uses `import yaml` to load configuration, but PyYAML is not listed in the dependencies, causing import errors. Update the dependency file (pyproject or requirements.txt) to add `pyyaml`.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should modify the dependency specification via PatchManager (for example, add `\"PyYAML\"` with an appropriate version in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` or in `requirements.txt`). After adding, use CodeFixer or a package manager command to ensure the library is installed in the development environment.
   **Expected Outcome:** The `yaml` module is available at runtime. Running the application or tests no longer raises `ModuleNotFoundError` for `yaml`. The configuration file loads correctly using the newly installed dependency.

2. **Title:** Verify All Required Dependencies Are Declared
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** Dependency configuration files (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`)
   **Action:** Audit the codebase for any other imports that are not declared in dependencies. For each external module used (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, etc.), ensure it is listed in the project’s dependencies. Add any missing ones to prevent runtime import errors.
   **Automation Guidance:** Utilize PatchManager to scan the repository for import statements of third-party libraries. The AI agent can cross-check these against the current dependency list. For any missing entries, update the dependency file accordingly. Consider using CodeFixer to suggest the latest compatible versions.
   **Expected Outcome:** The project’s dependency list is complete and accurate. All `import ...` statements correspond to installed packages, eliminating `ImportError` issues due to undeclared dependencies.

## Python Version Compatibility

1. **Title:** Ensure Python 3.8 Compatibility in Type Hints
   **Priority:** Critical
   **Affected Files:** Various modules using modern type hint syntax (e.g. `settings.py`, `config_manager.py`)
   **Action:** Replace Python 3.9+ type hint syntax with alternatives compatible with Python 3.8. For example, instances of using built-in generics like `dict[str, str]` or `list[int]` in type annotations should be changed to use the typing module (e.g. `Dict[str, str]`, `List[int]`) or be enclosed in string quotes (PEP 484 style) if needed. This aligns with Python 3.8, which does not support PEP 585 generic syntax. If such modern syntax is pervasive and upgrading the Python version is acceptable, update the project’s Python requirement to 3.9+, but the safer route is to adjust the code for compatibility.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should search the codebase for bracketed type hints on built-in types (using a regex like `\w+\[.*\]` in annotations). For each occurrence, modify the annotation to use the `typing` module equivalents or add `from __future__ import annotations` if it resolves the issue (though using typing is clearer). Use PatchManager to apply these changes. Optionally, run type-checking (with mypy or similar) to confirm that all type hints are now valid for Python 3.8.
   **Expected Outcome:** The codebase is fully compatible with Python 3.8. There are no syntax errors from type hints when running under Python 3.8. If the project’s `pyproject.toml` specifies Python 3.8, the code now adheres to that requirement (or the requirement is bumped to match the code, with team approval).

2. **Title:** Audit for Other Version-Specific Features
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** Project-wide
   **Action:** Check the code for usage of any other Python features that might not be available in the target Python version (3.8). This includes newer standard library functions or syntax (for example, the walrus operator `:=` is fine in 3.8+, but pattern matching (`match` statements) require Python 3.10). Identify any such usages and either remove/refactor them or update the project’s Python version if appropriate.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can use static code analysis or run the test suite under Python 3.8 to catch `SyntaxError` or `AttributeError` issues. Tools like pylint/flake8 with appropriate Python version settings can flag incompatible syntax. Use PatchManager to apply needed refactors (e.g., replace any unsupported feature with an alternative implementation).
   **Expected Outcome:** The entire codebase runs on the intended Python version without errors. Alternatively, if the decision is to upgrade the required Python version, the `pyproject.toml` reflects the new minimum version and this is communicated clearly. Compatibility between code and configuration is confirmed.

## Import Path Issues

1. **Title:** Validate and Correct Module Import Paths
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** Project-wide (all import statements and package init files)
   **Action:** Ensure that all module import paths are valid and resolve correctly. This involves checking that every `import` or `from ... import ...` corresponds to an existing module/package in the project or a dependency. Fix any broken import paths by adjusting the code or project structure. For example, if a module is in a subpackage, use relative imports or include an `__init__.py` to make it a proper package. Remove any temporary workarounds like manual `sys.path` modifications in the code.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should perform an import sweep: attempt to import each project module in an isolated environment (or use a linter that checks imports) to identify failures. Use PatchManager to add missing `__init__.py` files to directories that should be packages, or modify import statements to the correct package path. CodeFixer can assist by suggesting the correct import if a module was renamed or moved.
   **Expected Outcome:** The project’s import hierarchy is clean and correct. All modules can be imported without manual path fixes (e.g., running `python -m module_name` works as expected). This improves module reuse and installation of the package, preventing `ModuleNotFoundError` due to incorrect import paths.

2. **Title:** Implement Import Path Validation Test
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** (New) test module, or CI configuration
   **Action:** Add a lightweight validation step to catch import path issues in the future. For example, create a test (perhaps `test_imports.py`) that attempts to import all top-level modules of the project or configure CI to run `flake8`/`pyright` for import errors. This will proactively flag any missing modules or bad imports as the codebase grows.
   **Automation Guidance:** Using PatchManager, the AI agent can create a new test file that programmatically discovers modules and imports them, failing if any import raises an error. Alternatively, configure a static analysis tool in the pipeline. Ensure this runs as part of automated tests.
   **Expected Outcome:** The project will automatically catch import path regressions. Developers/AI agents will be alerted to broken import statements or missing package files early in the development cycle, ensuring robust module resolution.

## Unused Imports

1. **Title:** Remove Unused Import in `config_manager.py`
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `config_manager.py`
   **Action:** Delete the import statement for modules that are never used in `config_manager.py` (for example, an `import json` that isn’t referenced in the file). Unused imports clutter the code and can lead to minor performance overhead or namespace confusion.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can utilize a linter (like flake8 or pylint) to identify unused imports in `config_manager.py`. Using PatchManager, open the file and remove the unnecessary import lines. Before committing, ensure that the removal doesn’t break any implicit usage. (If the import was meant for side effects or future use, confirm with maintainers, but otherwise remove it.)
   **Expected Outcome:** `config_manager.py` contains only the imports that are actually needed. The code is cleaner and passes lint checks for unused imports.

2. **Title:** Remove Unused Import in `scheduler.py`
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `scheduler.py`
   **Action:** Eliminate any import in `scheduler.py` that isn’t utilized. For instance, if `import math` is present but no math functions are called, it should be removed. This reduces confusion and adheres to best practices.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should parse `scheduler.py` (potentially with an AST tool or CodeFixer’s analysis) to find imports not referenced elsewhere in the file. Use PatchManager to excise those lines. Run the test suite or module to ensure nothing indirectly relied on the import (e.g., no monkey-patching or side effects were expected, which is rare).
   **Expected Outcome:** `scheduler.py` no longer has redundant import lines. All imports in the file are necessary for its functionality, improving maintainability and readability.

3. **Title:** General Cleanup of Unused Imports Across Codebase
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** Multiple modules (e.g., utility modules, older scripts)
   **Action:** Conduct a project-wide cleanup of unused imports. Beyond the specific files above, it’s recommended to check every module for imports that can be removed. This task consolidates all such minor cleanups into one maintenance effort.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can run a static analysis tool globally to list all unused imports. Then, iteratively use PatchManager to open each affected file and remove those lines. Group related changes into a single commit if possible (since they are trivial and low risk).
   **Expected Outcome:** The entire codebase is free of unused import statements. Linting tools report no unused imports, and the risk of module name conflicts or unnecessary dependencies is minimized.

## Debug and Test Code Cleanup

1. **Title:** Remove Debug Print Statements from `data_processing.py`
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `data_processing.py`
   **Action:** Eliminate all debugging print statements and temporary test outputs from the data processing module. These might include `print()` calls used to log intermediate values or confirm behavior during development. Such statements should not appear in production code; if logging is needed, it should use a proper logging framework at an appropriate log level.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can search for `print(` occurrences in `data_processing.py`. For each, decide if it’s purely for debug (most likely yes if not part of normal output). Remove the line or convert it to use the module’s logger if one exists (for example, `logger.debug(...)`). Utilize PatchManager to apply these edits. Afterwards, run the module’s functionality (or tests) to ensure that removing the prints did not hide necessary output.
   **Expected Outcome:** `data_processing.py` runs without spurious console output. The code is cleaner and any necessary runtime information is handled via proper logging or removed if it was purely for debugging. This adheres to a reusable module design by not performing I/O on import or normal execution.

2. **Title:** Remove In-Module Test Code in `utils.py`
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `utils.py`
   **Action:** Extract or delete any test or demo code embedded in `utils.py`. Often, developers include an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block or other test snippets in utility modules for quick testing. These should be removed or moved to dedicated test files to keep the module lean and free of side-effects on import.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should open `utils.py` and locate any code that executes on import or on running the file as a script. This could be printing examples, running test functions, or demo usage. Using PatchManager, remove that code. If the logic is still valuable for understanding or testing, consider moving it into the official test suite or a separate example script (the agent can create a new file if instructed).
   **Expected Outcome:** `utils.py` contains only function and class definitions (and necessary imports), with no execution of code when the module is imported. The module is now solely focused on providing reusable utilities. Any informal tests or examples have been relocated to proper test files or documentation, preserving functionality without violating module design principles.

3. **Title:** Enforce Module Design in Core Library Files
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** All core library modules (project-wide scan)
   **Action:** As a broader maintenance measure, ensure that none of the library modules execute code on import or contain stray debug operations. This involves scanning all `.py` files (excluding entry-point scripts) for top-level code (outside of class/function definitions) that is not simply variable or constant definitions. Remove or refactor such code as needed.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can programmatically inspect each Python file for patterns like `if __name__ == "__main__":` or top-level loops/print statements. This can be done via AST or simple text search. Through PatchManager, modify the files to remove these patterns. If any top-level code is initializing necessary state, consider moving it into an initialization function. Use CodeFixer to verify that removing code doesn’t break the application (perhaps by running unit tests).
   **Expected Outcome:** All modules are passive on import (they don't execute test code or prints). The project conforms to a clean architecture where execution logic resides in designated scripts or test files, improving reusability and reducing side effects.

## YAML Configuration Validation

1. **Title:** Implement YAML Configuration Validation
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `config_loader.py` (or whichever module reads the YAML config), YAML config file (e.g., `config/settings.yaml`)
   **Action:** Add checks to validate the YAML configuration file’s presence and correctness at startup. This includes verifying that the YAML file exists at the expected path and that its contents conform to the expected schema or at least load without errors. If keys or values are critical, ensure the required fields are present and of the correct type.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can augment the config loading function. Using PatchManager, insert a try/except around the YAML loading (using `yaml.safe_load`). In case of a `YAMLError` (parse error) or missing keys, raise a clear exception or log an error message indicating the config problem. Optionally, the agent can introduce a simple schema (as a dictionary of expected keys) and validate against it. No external schema library is strictly necessary, but if precision is needed, consider adding one (and update dependencies accordingly).
   **Expected Outcome:** When the application starts, it will immediately report any issues with the YAML configuration (missing file, syntax error, missing required fields) in a clear manner. This prevents situations where the app might run with defaults or partially fail later due to bad config. The config validation improves reliability and ease of debugging deployment issues.

2. **Title:** Validate YAML Loading in Tests
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** `test_config.py` or similar (new or existing test file)
   **Action:** Create a test to ensure the YAML validation logic works. For example, add a unit test that intentionally feeds a malformed YAML or missing field scenario into the config loader and asserts that the proper exception or error message is raised. This guards the validation feature against regression.
   **Automation Guidance:** Using PatchManager, the AI agent can create a new test file if needed. Write test cases covering: (a) valid YAML loads successfully, (b) invalid YAML (bad syntax) triggers an error, (c) YAML missing a critical field triggers an error. This ensures the validation code is executed during automated testing.
   **Expected Outcome:** The YAML validation is not only implemented but also tested. Future changes to config structure will be caught by failing tests if they break the validation, ensuring the config file remains aligned with application expectations.

## Legacy Scripts Archival

1. **Title:** Archive Legacy Script `fix_database_encoding.py`
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** `fix_database_encoding.py` (standalone script)
   **Action:** Retire this standalone maintenance script from the active codebase. This script appears to be a one-time or outdated fix (e.g., for database text encoding) that is no longer needed now that similar functionality is handled by the centralized PatchManager or newer migration routines. The script should be removed from the main project directory to avoid confusion.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent should confirm that this script’s functionality is either obsolete or has been superseded. Then, using PatchManager, either delete the file or move it to a clearly marked `legacy/` or `archive/` folder in the repository (depending on project policy for archiving code). Update any documentation or references that might point to this script, noting its deprecation.
   **Expected Outcome:** `fix_database_encoding.py` is no longer part of the active codebase. Developers and AI agents will not accidentally run or maintain this file. The repository is streamlined, containing only relevant and current maintenance code.

2. **Title:** Archive Legacy Script `legacy_config_fixer.py`
   **Priority:** Optional
   **Affected Files:** `legacy_config_fixer.py`
   **Action:** Remove or archive the `legacy_config_fixer.py` script, which was used for older configuration fixes. Its responsibilities have presumably been integrated into the main code or are no longer required. Take it out of the main project to reduce clutter.
   **Automation Guidance:** With PatchManager, eliminate this file from the project. If the file’s logic is still needed on occasion, ensure an equivalent function exists in the new maintenance pipeline or document how to perform that fix manually. Otherwise, simply git-remove it. Also, search the codebase to ensure no one is importing or calling this script (unlikely if it’s standalone).
   **Expected Outcome:** The legacy config fixing script is archived. The project’s maintenance tasks are fully handled by the current modules (PatchManager/CodeFixer), and no outdated scripts remain to cause potential conflicts or confusion. The codebase maintenance is centralized and modernized.

3. **Title:** Document Archival of Legacy Maintenance Scripts
   **Priority:** Recommended
   **Affected Files:** `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`
   **Action:** Add notes in project documentation about the removal of these legacy scripts. This is to inform any collaborators or future maintainers why the scripts were removed and where to find them if needed (e.g., in source control history or an archive folder). This task ensures transparency in the maintenance process.
   **Automation Guidance:** The AI agent can update the README or CHANGELOG via PatchManager, listing the retired scripts and referencing the new mechanisms (PatchManager module, etc.) that replace their functionality. This is a straightforward edit, but important for completeness.
   **Expected Outcome:** Project documentation reflects the current state of maintenance tools and scripts. Anyone searching for the old scripts will be directed to the notes explaining their archival, preventing confusion.

## General-Purpose AI Agent Prompt Template

*(The following is a reusable prompt template to instruct AI agents for resolving maintenance tasks using PatchManager and CodeFixer.)*

```text
You are an AI code maintenance agent integrated with the project's PatchManager and CodeFixer modules. Your goal is to fix all identified codebase issues systematically.

**Instructions:**
1. **Understand the Tasks:** You are given a list of maintenance tasks (including priority, affected files, and actions required) for the project. Begin by reviewing these tasks and their details carefully.
2. **Prioritize:** Focus first on tasks marked "Critical", then "Recommended", and finally "Optional". This ensures that the most important fixes are applied first.
3. **Execute Fixes One by One:** For each task:
   - Locate and open the relevant file(s) using PatchManager.
   - Apply the described fix. If the fix is straightforward (e.g., remove an import or correct indentation), you can directly edit the code. For more complex changes, use the CodeFixer module to suggest or automate the modification.
   - After making the change, double-check that the issue is resolved. For example, run linters/tests for that file or the specific function in question if available.
   - Commit the change through PatchManager with a message referencing the task (for traceability).
4. **Verify and Iterate:** After each fix (or after all fixes), run the project’s test suite and linters to ensure no new issues were introduced. If any tests fail or new problems are detected, address them accordingly.
5. **Document Completion:** Once all tasks are completed, provide a brief summary of what was fixed for record-keeping (this could be automated via PatchManager’s logging).

By following these steps, you will systematically improve the codebase quality and maintainability. Focus on accuracy and keep changes minimal but effective, ensuring the project remains stable after each modification.
```

This template can be used to guide AI agents in resolving maintenance issues. It emphasizes a structured, step-by-step approach using the available tools, ensuring that critical problems are fixed first and that all changes are validated.
