The Python script py/powershell_executor.py would not compile due to inconsistent indentation. This is now corrected. Other large scripts such as launcher.py, enhanced_launcher.py, and deploy.py still contain indentation issues and will fail to compile.

fix: Re-indent the PowerShellExecutor class for valid Python syntax, ensuring proper block structure and type hints
